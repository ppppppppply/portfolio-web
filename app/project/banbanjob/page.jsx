        "BAN BANJOB" narrates the coexistence of a four-generational family,
        beginning with the grandma's generation and passing down to the father
        and mother's generation, then to the son, and finally to the
        grandchildren's generation. In this recent and unfamiliar area, what can
        we learn from this, and what should we particularly consider? The
        difference in ages reflects contrasting lifestyles, health, and tastes.
        That's why we prioritize individual differences, along with the central
        area, to encourage interaction among family members. Each person has
        their own separate daily routine. For example, grandma always wakes up
        and sleeps early; however, their children have to arrive home late at
        night because of the family's business, affecting their waking hours.
        Additionally, another factor in designing this house is to accommodate
        the family's expansion and provide support for the elders in the future.
        In an uncrowded 800-square-meter area, located opposite a kindergarten
        music school and surrounded by neighboring constructed houses, an orchid
        nursery in the back, and many neglected lands, various contextual
        aspects come to light. We aim to investigate the phenomena occurring in
        this area, including the noise from the school during different periods,
        particularly when children are arriving and departing, as well as the
        parental driving activity associated with dropping off their kids at
        school, which may pose safety concerns for the family. Additionally, we
        seek to explore the potential impact of the neglected area, particularly
        concerning the types of fertilizer and fungicide used in the nearby
        orchid nursery, on the residents of the house We began the design
        process by incorporating criteria derived from various functions to
        align with the characteristics of the area. For example, for individuals
        who wake up late, we selected the highest and farthest area of the house
        from the school, considering that sound in the afternoon may follow a
        curved path back to the ground due to atmospheric pressure. This design
        choice aims to minimize sound transmission to the rooms. Conversely, for
        the family members who wake up early, sleeping areas are situated
        towards the front of the house. This home is truly designed as two
        separate entities coming together to ensure the undisturbed space for
        each individual. The grandma, together with the mother and father,
        occupies one side, while the children have their space on the other
        side, each with a separate entrance. The sound from one side does not
        disturb the other. However, we maintain a connection between these two
        "houses" by prioritizing the significant courtyard and swimming pool
        area as a shared space for qualitative accessibility on the first and
        second floors. This design allows for a free space that separates the
        two sections. Nevertheless, there is also a pathway provided for the
        father and mother to conveniently cross between the two sides for the
        purpose of raising their grandchild. For this reason, the house is being
        known as ‘BAN BUNJOB’. If we focus on the overall view of this house,
        the building's form has been developed through the principles of modern
        architecture, considering the arrangement of functions and their causes
        and effects, resulting in a novel appearance. The sloped roof, starting
        from the highest point on one side and gradually tilting to reach the
        same level as the other side in a U-shape design, is intended to
        minimize disturbance to the upper room. Additionally, we designed this
        tall building to cast shade over the courtyard in the afternoon until
        sunset, where the family spends the most time outdoors. Despite the
        modern features of this house, our primary focus is ensuring
        satisfaction for the four generations residing within. The house's
        aesthetic is characterized by natural materials, such as grey terracotta
        bricks, giving the massive structure an ordinary appearance while
        softening its overall look with friendly light reflection for neighbors.
        Additionally, we opted for genuine wood in many parts of the building to
        impart warmth to the house's surfaces, complemented by white-colored
        walls reminiscent of a gallery to show artworks, which holds
        significance for the owner. We expect that the results of our dedicated
        efforts in being considerate of this house will allow the architecture
        to perfectly fulfill its responsibility in serving our intended purpose
